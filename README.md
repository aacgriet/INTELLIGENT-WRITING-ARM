# INTELLIGENT-WRITING-ARM

Speech writing machine is a device which is nowhere designed previously and is only one of its kind. Many people who are born without hands take their life as a challenge and try to prove themselves. Though they donâ€™t have hands they keep trying to write with their legs, mouth, etc. to reach their desired position in life. 
And here is the device which will help them achieve their goals. This device converts all the speech that is said by the user into text and then writes the same on a paper.As of 
now there is no such project that has been designed to provide such benefits.


The main purpose of doing this project is to make the disabled (handless) people to write through their speech
This process involves conversion of speech to text and that converted text is to be written on the paper.
	
  a) This is to build a better society
  
  b) This acts as an artificial hand to the handless people.
